# ✅ LIVE LIKE COUNTER MOVED TO TOP

## Changes Made

Moved the **heart like counter** from the bottom profile area to the **top right** near the "For You" feed area.

### Before:
- Like counter was inside the profile button at the bottom
- Small size (`10px` text, tiny heart)
- Hidden inside profile info

### After:
- Like counter now at **top right** corner
- Larger and more visible
- Near where live likes appear when tapping screen
- Above the logout button
- Positioned in the natural "For You" area

### New Position:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Profile   ❤️ 1,234 [X] │  ← Heart counter here!
│                         │
│                         │
│     Live Stream         │
│                         │
│                         │
│ Bottom Controls         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Size Changes:
- Heart icon: `12px → 16px` (larger)
- Text: `10px → 14px` (bigger font)
- More prominent display

## Result

- ✅ Like counter moved to top right
- ✅ More visible and prominent
- ✅ Better positioned for live interaction
- ✅ Shows live likes as they come in
- ✅ Cleaner profile button (removed heart from there)

## How to Test

1. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. **Go to Live Stream page**
3. **Look at top right** - you'll see the heart with like count
4. **Tap screen** - likes increase and show in that area

**Like counter is now at the top right where it belongs!**
