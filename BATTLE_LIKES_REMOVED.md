# ✅ ALL LIKES REMOVED FROM BATTLE PAGE

## Changes Made

Removed **ALL heart/like counters** from the battle page.

### Removed from Battle Mode:

1. ❌ **Heart with like count** under creator name (battle mode top left)
2. ❌ **Small heart counter** from broadcaster info (non-battle mode)

### What Was Removed:

**Battle Mode Top Section:**
```
Before:
┌────────────────────┐
│ Creator Name       │
│ ❤️ 1,234          │ ← REMOVED
└────────────────────┘

After:
┌────────────────────┐
│ Creator Name       │ ← Clean, no likes
└────────────────────┘
```

**Non-Battle Broadcast Mode:**
```
Before:
┌────────────────────┐
│ [Avatar] Creator   │
│ LIVE ❤️ 7         │ ← REMOVED
└────────────────────┘

After:
┌────────────────────┐
│ [Avatar] Creator   │
│ LIVE               │ ← Clean
└────────────────────┘
```

## What Remains:

**Regular Live Stream (Viewer Mode):**
- ✅ Heart counter still shows under profile (left side)
- ✅ Live likes accumulate when tapping screen
- ✅ Normal "For You" feed functionality

**Battle Mode:**
- ❌ NO like counters shown
- ✅ Clean battle interface
- ✅ Focus on battle scores only

## Result

- ✅ Battle page completely clean (no hearts/likes)
- ✅ Broadcaster mode clean (no small heart counter)
- ✅ Regular viewer mode still has likes under profile
- ✅ Battle focuses on battle scores, not likes

## How to Test

1. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. **Start a battle** - no like counters should show
3. **Check broadcast mode** - cleaner, no extra heart
4. **Check viewer mode** - likes still work under profile

**All likes removed from battle page!**
